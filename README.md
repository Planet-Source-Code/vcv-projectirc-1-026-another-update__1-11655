### Description

Yet another update. This time I added the "friend tracker", basically just a notify lists to see who's on. I added support for hyperlinks, so you can right click addresses and it will shell to them. The taskbar will now notify you when an inactive window has new data. Fixed a few bugs. A few of the options work now, and save. There is a "debug" window, which just displays all incoming and outgoing data. You can move both the toolbar and taskbar to the top or bottom. That's about it I think, enjoy.
